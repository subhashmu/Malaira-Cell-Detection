# Malaira-Cell-Detection
Detection of  Parasitized and Uninfected Cells for detecting Malaria.

This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/

2. Preprocessed and applied Augmentation

3. Imported object detection and classification algorithms such as
VGG16,ResNet50 and InceptionV3 to train the model.

4. Calculated the time required to train using each model and obtained
a Graphical representation of accuracy and losses with each one.
 
5. Obtained Highest accuracy of 91.49 using VGG16.
